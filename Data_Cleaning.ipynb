    "To further investigate we watched multiple scenes that there was a character talked more than 10 sentences in a row.  \n",
    "We saw that many of them are actual long monologues by one character, and some are mistakes.  \n",

    "We watched several episodes and looked at the dataset at the same time.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We saw that the text is pretty accurate, subject to minor changes the man (or machine) did.  \n",
    "These changes are not really an influence to our task, because most of the time they have the same meaning.  \n",
    "For example, \"You met her in the supermrket. How did you do that?\" is shorten to \"You met her in the supermrket. How?\".  \n",
    "For humor detection, this is not really a severe issue.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The timing of the talking are also pretty accurate, and by reading the paper of Ran Yad-Shalom who created this dataset he addressed this issue specifically and payed extra attention to take several subtitles and choose the one that is best aligned with the audio.  \n",
    "His job here is pretty impressive...  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The laughs - not perfect.  \n",
    "It's mostly labeled correctly, but there are some false-positives.  \n",
    "Also, the timing of the laughs are not measured perfectly.  \n",
    "It's quite understandable, because in the show it's also not so obvious when the laugh start and when it ends.  \n",
    "So extracting it automatically by analyzing the audio (like Ran Yad-Shalom did) seems pretty challenging.  \n",
    "However, because most of the time it's actually labels correctly, we treat this as acceptable noise in our dataset and continue with our work.  "
